## 🤖 How Beemo Robot Connects to the Platform

### Command Flow Architecture
1. **Robot Receives Commands**: Beemo robot receives voice commands or detects environmental changes
2. **Platform Communication**: Robot sends processed commands to the customizable platform via secure API
3. **Platform Processing**: The platform interprets commands and determines appropriate actions
4. **Device Control**: Platform executes commands on connected office devices (lights, HVAC, projectors, etc.)
5. **Status Feedback**: Platform sends confirmation back to Beemo robot for user feedback

### Real-time Communication Protocol
```
Beemo Robot ←→ Custom Platform ←→ Office Devices

Commands:
Robot → Platform: "Turn on conference room lights"
Platform → Devices: Execute lighting control
Platform → Robot: "Conference room lights activated"
Robot → User: Display confirmation + emotion
```
